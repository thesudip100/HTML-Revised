    <h3>Id and classes in HTML</h3>
    <div id="mainBox" class="redBg blackBorder">
        this is mainbox
    </div>
    <!-- id is for identifying all the elements inside above div tag (id cannot be same for two elements i.e it is unique i.e. I cannot make another div with id-mainBox)
    
    
    suppose, I want to set the background of 100 elements to red. It will be hectic to do it one by one. In that case, class comes handy. We can place all the elements inside the same class and target that class to change the background of 100 elements at once.

    1 element has only 1 id i.e id is unique for every element.
    Multiple elements can have single class.Also, single element can have multiple class. eg- redBg anf blackBorder are classes for div element.
